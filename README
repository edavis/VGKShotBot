@VGKShotBot is a Twitter bot that sends a tweet after every VGK shot attempt with information about the shot.

Information included, in no particular order:

- Goal?
- EV/PP/SH
- Period/Time
- Shooter/Assists
- Distance
- Angle
- Type of shot (Wrist, Slap, Tip-in, etc)
- Eventually: What % of the time is that shot a goal?
- Eventually: Official media of goals/highlights attached

Last season (2018-19) it looks like shot attempts per game ranged between 25-50, so nothing too crazy.
